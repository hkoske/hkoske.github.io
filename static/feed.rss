<p>I watched this inspiring video by a great golang programmer. He answered a question that he got in an email. I really liked a quote he mentioned, albeit somewhat incorrectly misreported. </p>

<p>The actual quote was: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The soul is dyed the color of its thoughts. Think only on those things that are in line with your principles and can bear the light of day. The content of your character is your choice.
